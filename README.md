# react-timer

This is my first attempt in React.

##### 4 components
* APP
* Panel
* CountButton
* StartButton

##### Core tech :
* requestAnimationFrame
* localStorage
* momentjs
* flex layout

The design comes from the timer on **iPhone**.
Please visit [Live demo](https://xinkule.github.io/react-timer/) on mobile phone for best experience.
